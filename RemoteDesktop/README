 What is Remote Desktop Web App?
------------------------------------------------------------

Remote Desktop web app.The web application was based on top of Guacamole framework
and guacamole-client application . 
Guacamole is an open source framework for clientless RDP app and the 
Guacamole-client is an HTML5 web application that provides access to your desktop using
remote desktop protocols. Our application is based on Guacamole to provide remote services 
to specific clients. This application is also integrated with a Kurento Media server (another open source 
media server project which facilitates webRTC communication framework)

A centralized server acts as a tunnel and proxy,
allowing access to multiple desktops through a web browser; no plugins needed.
The client requires nothing more than a web browser supporting HTML5 and AJAX.
